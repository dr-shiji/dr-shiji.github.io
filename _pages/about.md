About Me
------
I received my PhD degree in Applied Mathematics from Tsinghua University in 2018. From 2018 to 2020, I worked at Beijing huahang radio measurement institute as an engineer. After that I joined Capital Normal University as a postdoctoral researcher in 2020, and was appointed as an associate researcher since later 2022. My research interests focus on the interdisciplinary area of applied mathematics, control and image processing, using probabilistic methods, numerical computational methods and machine learning tools to address various important questions in **System state estimation**, **Intelligent robotic control**, and **Medical image processing**. I have published more than 20 papers in high-impact journals and conferences, including top-tier venues such as IEEE TAC, SIAM J. Control Optim., and IEEE TMI.
