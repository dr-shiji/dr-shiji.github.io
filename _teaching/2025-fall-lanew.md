Linear Algebra for New Engineering is an important compulsory foundation mathematics course designed for university majors such as Artificial Intelligence and other emerging engineering disciplines. The course consists of four parts. The first part introduces the basic operations of vectors and the most common linear space—the Euclidean space, and explains the concept of determinants in Euclidean space using geometric methods. The second part covers matrix theory and systematic methods for solving linear equations, illustrating the core functions of linear algebra through concrete examples drawn from real-life contexts. The third part demonstrates how to reinterpret linear systems from the perspective of linear mappings. It explains key concepts of linear algebra such as inner products, orthogonality, eigenvalues, singular values, and diagonalization, while also presenting numerous application cases including graphs and networks, Markov processes, 3D point cloud fusion, and image data compression. The fourth part introduces general linear spaces, especially infinite-dimensional linear spaces. Building on the theory of infinite-dimensional spaces, it explains the principles and applications of Fourier analysis—an essential tool in engineering—and showcases the significant role of linear algebra in Artificial Intelligence through tasks such as recognition and classification. By completing this course, students will master the linear algebraic theories essential for Artificial Intelligence and other New Engineering disciplines, develop abstract thinking, logical reasoning, and comprehensive problem-solving skills, and lay the necessary mathematical foundation for future study and work.
